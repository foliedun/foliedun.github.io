# 5. Digital modulation

As seen before, RFID uses electromagnetic waves as a means of communication in the physical world. This way, for the exchange of information to occur, it's necessary that the data in digital format (zeros and ones) be transformed into analog format (electromagnetic waves), in other words, we need a way to "insert" those bits into the electromagnetic waves, so they can be emitted and received by tag and reader antennas. This process is known as **digital modulation**, or simply **modulation**. 

The electromagnetic wave used is called **carrier wave**, while the reverse process of extracting the original information from this wave is known as **demodulation**.

There are three basic modulation techniques, all of them manipulating one of the three basic characteristics of waves: amplitude, frequency or phase. All other modulation techniques are derived from these three basic methods. 

## 5.1. Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)

Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) happens when the amplitude of the carrier wave oscillates between two distinct values, where a higher amplitude value represents the bit 1 while a lower amplitude value represents the bit 0. The image below might make things a little clearer:

Due to its simplicity, this modulation technique can be implemented in any RFID system, provides the fastest data transfer rate but the worst resistance to interference.

## 5.2. Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)

Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) happens when the frequency of the carrier wave oscillates between two distinct values, where a higher frequency value represents the bit 1 while a lower frequency value represents the bit 0. Again the image below might make things a little clearer:

This modulation technique have the slowest data transfer rate but the best resistance to interference.

## 5.3. Phase Shift Keying (PSK)

Phase Shift Keying (PSK) happens by changing the phase of the carrier wave, and this is possible by varying the sine and cosine inputs at a particular time. Due to this permissibility, PSK has some sub-variations, but we will only talk about the "Binary Phase Shift Keying" (BPSK or 2PSK).

In the BSPK, whenever a transition of the digital signal values ​​occurs, there will be a 180 degree change in the phase of the carrier wave, that is, whenever there is a transition from bit 0 to bit 1, or vice versa, the carrier phase will be switched 180 degrees. The image below might make things a little clearer:

As only the phase of the carrier wave is modulated, it's possible to transfer more information in the same period of time, resulting in a data tranfer rate higher if compared to FSK but still lower than ASK. Its resistance to interference is moderate and is relatively simple to be implemented.

## Summary

The following image shows what each wave looks like after each modulation technique:
