# 6. Data encoding

Data encoding is the process of changing the bitstream (a sequence of 0s and 1s) of data to a format so they can travel safely along the path between communication components. Not every data encoding can be implemented in every system, characteristics like: number of bits to be encoded, minimum required transfer rate, redundancy required for error recovery and others, influence in the type of encoding that can be implemented.

Data encoding is a huge topic by its own, so we will only talk superficially about the three most popular methods used in RFID systems: Non-Return to Zero (NRZ) Direct, Differential Biphase and Biphase_L (Manchester)

## 6.1. Non-Return to Zero Direct
