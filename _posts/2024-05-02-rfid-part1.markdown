This is the first in a series of posts about RFID, an old passion of mine.

# 1. Introduction

**R**adio-**f**requency **id**entification, or RFID, is a technology of wireless communication that uses electromagnetic fields and radio waves to remotely store, retrieve, exchange or identify information digitally contained in special devices known as RFID tags.

It's widely present in our daily lives, like in:
* Access control
* Contactless payment
* Inventory control
* Tracking
* Anti-theft system

and many others

# 2. Basic system components

RFID systems are generally made up of 4 basic components:
* Tag or transponder
* Reader or interrogator
* Middleware or controller
* Host software, enterprise software, management software and etc

which will be discussed in more detail below

## 2.1. Tag or transponder

## 2.2. Reader or interrogator

## 2.3. Middleware or controller

## 2.4. Host software


Work in progress
