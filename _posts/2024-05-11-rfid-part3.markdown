Understanding how RFID communicates is an interesting knowledge for those who want to implement it, for such, we will need to dive into some physical principles, such as electricity and magnetism.

# 4. RFID coupling mechanisms

For the tag and reader to communicate, their circuits need to couple, to pair. In physics, two objects are coupled when they interact with each other, so, in the RFID context, coupling happens when there is a transfer of energy and/or data between tag and reader. This process is known as **RFID coupling mechanism**.

The main coupling mechanisms used are: backscatter coupling or backscattering, capacitive coupling and inductive coupling. Sometimes the terms "magnetic coupling" or "electromagnetic coupling" can be seen, however, those terms refers to any coupling that happens using the electromagnetic field of reader and tag. The coupling mechanisms affects various aspects of the RFID communication, such as reading range, required frequency, hardware needs and etc. For example, low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) are mainly used with inductive and capacitive coupling, while ultra high frequency (UHF) is more used with the backscatter coupling.

## 4.1. Backscatter coupling or backscattering

In physics, backscattering is the reflection of waves, particles or signals back to the direction of the source, in other words, it's a type of dispersion (scattering) in which the angle of reflection is around 180 degrees. <!-- It's considered a diffuse reflection due to its dispersion. -->It happens because most objects with dimensions greater than half of the wavelength of the incident electromagnetic wave are capable of reflecting part of this wave back to the emitter. In this sense, the backscattering found in RFID is quite similiar to the ones used in radars, for example.

Back to RFID, in this coupling mechanism the radio frequency waves emitted by the reader are used to energize or to wake up the tag. The tag then re-radiates part of the received waves back to the reader, but changing some of the wave properties to encode and send its information back. The image below exemplifies this behaviour.

To allow the transmission and reception of signals at the same time, a directional coupler is often needed to allow the received signal to be separated from the transmitted one. The reader also needs to be able to detect the modulation used by the tag in the presense of many other backscatterings.

Due to the characteristics of backscattering, the radio waves emitted can travel far beoynd the tag or reader, allowing it to operate over long distances and being widely used in RFID systems with ultra high frequency (UHF) tags.

## 4.2. Capacitive coupling

Capacitive coupling, also known as electric coupling, uses the concept of capacitors and capacitance to couple tag and reader, but what is capacitors and capacitance?

In physics, a capacitor, or condenser, is an object consisting of two electrical conductors, usually two metal plates, isolated from each other by a non-conductive material, known as dielectric. When in operation, each plate will accumulate a type of electrical charge and from this potential difference an electric field is created between the plates. For example, when an electrical current is applied to the system, one plate will become more negatively charged (Q⁻) while the other will become more positively charged (Q⁺), from this difference an electric field is created between the plates.

This way, capacitors have as main function to store the electrical potential energy that is established between their conductors in the form of an electric field, being so good at it that the potential difference between its conductos remains for a certain time even if there is no electrical supply.

Já a capacitância é a habilidade de um corpo em armazenar energia elétrica. Também é um termo que se refere a quantidade de energia elétrica que um capacitor pode armazenar. Quanto maior a capacitância maior será a quantidade de energia que pode ser armazenada.
