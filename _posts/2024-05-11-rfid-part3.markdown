Understanding how RFID communicates is an interesting knowledge for those who want to implement it, for such, we will need to dive into some physical principles, such as electricity and magnetism.

# 4. RFID coupling mechanisms

For the tag and reader to communicate, their circuits need to couple, to pair. In physics, two objects are coupled when they interact with each other, so, in the RFID context, coupling happens when there is a transfer of energy and/or data between tag and reader. This process is known as **RFID coupling mechanism**.

The main coupling mechanisms used are: backscatter/backscattering coupling, capacitive coupling and inductive coupling. Sometimes the terms "magnetic coupling" or "electromagnetic coupling" can be seen, however, those terms refers to any coupling that happens using the electromagnetic field of reader and tag. The coupling mechanisms affects various aspects of the RFID communication, such as reading range, required frequency, hardware needs and etc. For example, low frequency and high frequency are mainly used with inductive and capacitive coupling, while ultra-high frequency is more used with the backscatter coupling.
