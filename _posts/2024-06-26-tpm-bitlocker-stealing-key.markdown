Hey,\
Hi friend, nice to see you again!

Today we'll talk about TPM, BitLocker, Windows full disk encryption and how to steal the key to the kingdom. Hope you enjoy.
<br /><br />

Some time ago, during a meeting, a client came with the following scenario: Imagine if the laptop of one of the company's VIP is lost or stolen, what could be done?\
Although we have never researched or done anything remotely close to this, we couldn't refuse a challenge (mainly when someone dares you can't), and even if success was not possible the knowledge would be interesting and valuable.

This study is a hands-on approach to the excellent research [Sniff, there leaks my BitLocker key](https://labs.withsecure.com/publications/sniff-there-leaks-my-bitlocker-key) by Henri Nurmi. In his post, Mr. Nurmi does a sublime job explaining how he achieved this, really recommend reading.

Before jumping to the fun part, let's see a little about BitLocker and TPM.


# BitLocker 

BitLocker is a Windows security feature present since Windows Vista/Server 2008 that provides encryption for entire volumes/disks. It was implemented to address the growing concern of data theft in case of physical access to the disk, like in stolen or lost laptops and hard drives.

Since Windows 10, BitLocker uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as encryption algorithm with CBC (AES-CBC) for removable data drives, XTS (XTS-AES) for OS volumes and fixed drivers and configurable key lengths of 128 bits (default) or 256 bits.


## Architecture overview

How does it works?\
Briefly, the volume's raw data is encrypted with a **Full Volume Encryption Key (FVEK)**, this FVEK is then encrypted by a **Volume Master Key (VMK)** and stored in the metadata section of the encrypted volume. The VMK is then encrypted by one or more of the several possible key protectors and recovery scenarios and also stored in volume's metadata.

<figure style="display: inline-block;">

  <figcaption style="text-align: center;">BitLocker keys - Source: [20]</figcaption>
</figure>

You may be thinking "why use this three-key-schema? Why do not directly encrypt the FVEK with the key protectors?". Simple, in the case of any of the key protectors is compromised, corrupted or changed, all key protectors can be replaced and only a new VMK will have to be created, the FVEK will not change and the encrypted volume will not have to be reencrypted.

Ok, but what the heck is key protectors and recovery scenarios?

**Key protector** is an authentication method used to prevent the VMK from being stored in the volume in plaintext, which could compromise the strength of the implementation. A key protector can be one of the following methods: [7]
* Trusted Platform Module(TPM): Uses the computer's TPM to protect the encryption key. Users can access the encrypted drive as long as it is connected to the system board that hosts the TPM and the system boot integrity is intact.
* TPM and Personal Identification Number(PIN): Uses a combination of the TPM and a user-supplied PIN. By default a PIN is four to twenty digits or, if enhanced PIN is enabled, four to twenty letters, symbols, spaces, or numbers.
* TPM, PIN, and startup key: Uses a combination of the TPM, a user-supplied PIN, and input from of a USB memory device that contains an external key.
* TPM and startup key: Combination of the TPM and input from of a USB memory device.
* Startup key: Uses input from of a USB memory device that contains the external key.
* Password: Uses a user defined password.
* Recovery key: Uses a self-generated recovery key stored as a specified file in a USB memory device.
* Recovery password: Uses self-generated recovery password.
* Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) account: Uses domain authentication to unlock data volumes. Operating system volumes cannot use this type of key protector.

  <figcaption style="text-align: center;">BitLocker preboot with pin - Source: [2]</figcaption>
</figure>

**Recovery scenario**, or BitLocker recovery mode, is the process by which access to a BitLocker-protected volume can be restored if the volume could not be unlocked by its default unlock mechanism. It can happen by several reasons, like: [8]
* Entering the wrong PIN too many times.
* Changes to the NTFS partition table on the disk
* Changes to the boot manager
* Turning off, disabling, deactivating, or clearing the TPM
* TPM self-test failure
* Upgrading the motherboard to a new one with a new TPM
* Upgrading critical early startup components, such as a BIOS or UEFI firmware upgrade
* Modifying the Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs) used by the TPM validation profile
* Moving a BitLocker-protected drive into a new computer
* On devices with TPM 1.2, changing the BIOS or firmware boot device order
* Exceeding the maximum allowed number of failed sign-in attempts

# Trusted Platform Module (TPM)

Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is an international standard (ISO/IEC 11889) to hardware-based cryptographic chips, usually implemented as a dedicated microcontroller (cryptoprocessor) or embedded into the CPU, designed to enhance systems' security by providing the following capabilities:
* General cryptographic operations
* Random number generator and generation of cryptographic keys
* Keys and secrets storage
* Binding/wrapping
* Tamper resistance
* System integrity check (verify if the boot process was started by a previously trusted combination of hardware and software)

**TPM works with BitLocker by ensuring the devices's hardware and software/firmware weren't tampered, and if everything is fine, it releases the key to decrypt the VMK.**

</figure>

What if my computer does not have a separated TPM chip? No worries, it's been a long time since Intel and AMD had embedded its microprocessors with TPM functionalities, a technology known as "integrated TPM" or "CPU-based TPM". On the blue side, Intel states that its processors, since 8th generation (Coffee Lake), have an integrated TPM that adheres to the 2.0 specifications and offers the same capabilities of a discrete TPM, but residing in systemâ€™s firmware, known as Intel PTT (Platform Trust Technology)[9]. On the red side, information is a little more dispersed, but several unofficial sources claim that AMD processors have a TPM implementation since Ryzen Zen 1, known as AMD fTPM (firmware TPM).


## Architecture overview

**Endorsement Key (EK)** is an RSA asymmetric key pair (EKPriv and EKPub) burned into the TPM chip at manufacturing time (stored in a non-volatile memory space). It's unique for every chip and can be used to identify the chip itself. It cannot be accessed, changed or removed by any external entity.\
Due to its uniqueness, is only used in a limited number of procedures. Therefore, to protect user's privacy when interacting with other entities, the use of the EK is restricted and Attestation Identity Keys (AIKs) are generated and used for routine transactions. [13]

**Storage Root Key (SRK)** is an RSA asymmetric key pair generated by the TPM when a user/process takes ownership of it. In our case, is the Windows OS that takes this ownership when it boots for the first time. The SRK is stored internally in a non-volatile memory space, and while the private key is inaccessible externally, the public key can be accessed.\
The process of encrypting a secret/key with the public SRK is called "binding" or "wrapping". This way the secret can only be decrypted by the TPM, which helps to protect against a myriad of attacks.

**Attestation Identity Key (AIK)** is an asymmetric key pair that work as an "alias" for the EK, being the one used for routine transactions. It's mainly used to provide platform authentication based on the attestation capability of the TPM (attestation = evidence or proof of something).

**Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs)** are memory locations in the TPM chip mainly used to store hardware and software integrity measurements, which will be used later to prove the integrity of the system.

For example, the validation process start by checking the BIOS, creating and storing a hash of it in a PCR; then the hardware is checked, with a hash of it also stored in a PCR; next the same happens to the partition table (MBR/GPT) of the disk, and so on. Each stage of the boot process is responsible for hashing the next and storing it in a PCR.

# Avenues of attack

The first boot was smooth and we were presented with the Windows login screen after a few seconds, which is good because it means the machine was not configured with pre-boot authentication.\
After a bit of research we found the following image from the terrific work [An ice-cold boot to break bit locker](https://www.slideshare.net/MSbluehat/bluehat-v18-an-icecold-boot-to-break-bit-locker) by Olle Segerdahl & Pasi Saarinen, that gave us a north direction:

<figure style="display: inline-block;">
  <img style="vertical-align: top;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/bitlocker/volume-attacks.png" width="50%" height="50%" alt="Volume keys attacks">
  <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Volume keys attacks - Source: [22]</figcaption>
</figure>

The **Recovery Keys** section was out-of-scope, whe didn't have access to their network nor their AD, and social engineering was denied (it always is).

The **Stored in RAM** section had a good potential, mainly because the RAM chip was removable, but due to some constraints we decided to leave it as a second option.\
Why attacks to the RAM would probably work? <!--Beyond all the technical details of a cold boot attack,--> By the time the computer boots and reaches the Windows login screen, a lot already happened: TPM verified the system integrity, released the protector to decrypt the VMK, BitLocker used the plain VMK to decrypt the volume, the system was mounted and ready to the user. In the end, the VMK is decrypted and stored in plain in computer's RAM, the ideal scenario for a memory attack like the cold boot attack.

The **Wrapped by TPM** section seemed quite impossible at first, but then we found the excellent research [Sniff, there leaks my BitLocker key](https://labs.withsecure.com/publications/sniff-there-leaks-my-bitlocker-key) by Henri Nurmi, what we decided to try first.


# The heist

If we want to attack the TPM, we first need to find the TPM, and to this we need the motherboard schematics of the machine:

<figure style="display: inline-block;">
  <img style="vertical-align: top;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/bitlocker/mobo-schematics1.png" width="70%" height="70%" alt="Motherboard schematics">
  <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Motherboard schematics</figcaption>

  <img style="vertical-align: top;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/bitlocker/mobo-schematics2.png" width="10%" height="10%" alt="Motherboard schematics zoom">
  <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Motherboard schematics zoom</figcaption>
</figure>

Great, our machine not only have a dedicated TPM chip (*TPM1.2/2.0 Nuvoton NPCT750JAAYX*) but also communicates with the CPU by a SPI bus shared with other chip (*W25Q128JVSIQ*). The schematic also have details about these chips:

<figure style="display: inline-block;">
  <img style="vertical-align: top;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/bitlocker/mobo-schematics3.png" alt="TPM chip">
  <figcaption style="text-align: center;">TPM chip</figcaption>

  <img style="vertical-align: top;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/bitlocker/mobo-schematics4.png" width="70%" height="70%" alt="W25Q128JVSIQ chip">
  <figcaption style="text-align: center;">W25Q128JVSIQ chip</figcaption>
</figure>

Wait, 128Mb Flash ROM? YES! We're talking about the BIOS chip here! So, essentially, our **TPM chip communicates with the CPU by a SPI bus shared with the BIOS chip**.\
But why this is so amazing? Because if we take a look in this TPM chip we will see it's of type QFN-32, which makes contact with its pins much much harder. The BIOS chip, on the other hand, is usually much bigger and with pins much easier to be hooked, and **because they share the same SPI bus we can sniff the CPU-TPM communication by hooking the BIOS**. Simply fantastic!

<figure style="display: inline-block;">

  <figcaption style="text-align: center;">W25Q128JVSIQ chip</figcaption>
</figure>

What can happen is that the actual BIOS chip in the motherboard is from a different brand than the one in the schematics, but no worries, they should be quite identical. In our case we have a "GIGADEVICE GD25B127D", and the schematics of both are identical:

<figure style="display: inline-block;">
  <img style="vertical-align: top;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/bitlocker/GD25B127D-schematics0.png" width="50%" height="50%" alt="GD25B127D schematics">
  <figcaption style="text-align: center;">GD25B127D schematics</figcaption>
</figure>

Now comes the expensive part. Theoretically, to the spoofing, we would require a logic analyzer capable of recording four logic signals simultaneously at a sampling rate of 100MHz. I say theoretically because the sampling rate of 100MHz is due to the theoretical average speed of SPI, however, as we'll see later on, we ended up needing much more than this, so beware when buying a logic analyzer different from the one used here. Nevertheless, we'll use a [Saleae Logic Pro 8](https://www.saleae.com/products/saleae-logic-pro-8) (told it would be expensive).\
Both Arduino and Raspberry Pi have projects to transform them into a logic analyzer, so they can come in hand for future projects, but not in here. 

Finally hooking some wires, but how? Well, SPI communicates through four logic signals:
* CS (Chip Select): Line used by the Master to indicate which Slave he's communicating with. This is the only line that cannot be shared between Slaves, with each one having a separated CS line to the Master
* SCLK/CLK (Serial Clock): Line used by the Master to indicate the communication clock to the Slave
* MOSI (Master Out Slave In): Line used to transfer data from Master to Slave
* MISO (Master In Slave Out): Line used to transfer data from Slave to Master

By using the schematics above, and the small dot in both schematic and chip as a guide, the hooking looks like this:
* Yellow wire: from Saleae port 0 to chip pin 1 (CS)
* Green wire: from Saleae port 1 to chip pin 2 (SO)
* Black wire: from Saleae port "ground" to chip pin 4 (VSS)
* Blue wire: from Saleae port 2 to chip pin 6 (SCLK)
* Purple wire: from Saleae port 3 to chip pin 5 (SI)

  <!-- <figcaption style="text-align: center;">BIOS chip hooked</figcaption> -->
</figure>

On the software side, we will use the free [Logic 2](https://www.saleae.com/pages/downloads) from Saleae, with the custom high-level analyzer extension [bitlocker-spi-toolkit](https://github.com/WithSecureLabs/bitlocker-spi-toolkit), which will do all the hard work for us.

When you open the Logic 2 with a Saleae attached you're directly redirect to the capture session screen, where we'll set device parameters, like add the digital signals from 0 to 3, change their names to relate with our pinouts (you don't have to, but helps), set the sampling rate to 250 MS/s and the voltage to 3.3+ Volts. I did some tests with different rates and voltages but these were what worked to me:

<figure style="display: inline-block;">

  <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Logic 2 configured</figcaption>
</figure>

Next we go to the "Extensions" tab, where we'll load the "BitLocker Key Extractor" from [bitlocker-spi-toolkit](https://github.com/WithSecureLabs/bitlocker-spi-toolkit).

<figure style="display: inline-block;">
  <img style="vertical-align: top;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/bitlocker/logic2_extension1.png" width="50%" height="50%" alt="Logic 2 load extension">

  <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Logic 2 load extension</figcaption>
</figure>

Last the "Analyzers" tab, where we'll set and configure the communication protocol (SPI) and the "BitLocker Key Extractor" extension. There's a trick here, if you remember we're capturing the TPM signals through the BIOS chip, so our CS signal is inverted for what it should be and tha's exactly what we're changing below:

  <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Logic 2 bitlocker extractor</figcaption>  
</figure>

With everything set, we can finally capture the VMK. Press the play/capture buttom, turn on the laptop, wait and pray (and don't forget to stop the capturing when Windows finishes booting). If everything run as expected you'll get the **VMK in hex**:

<figure style="display: inline-block;">
  <img style="vertical-align: top;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/bitlocker/logic2_capture1.png" width="50%" height="50%" alt="Logic 2 capturing VMK">

  <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Logic 2 capturing VMK</figcaption>  
</figure>

With the VMK in hands we have two options: boot the laptop with a USB live Linux, like Ubuntu, or steal the HD/SSD and connect it to another machine with Linux. For the sake of simplicity we'll boot into a Ubuntu and mount the encrypted volume. To this we'll use the "xxd" command to convert the VMK from hex to binary, the "dislocker" tool to decrypt the volume and the "mount" command to mount the decrypted volume:

```bash
$ echo "449387debd4edbbc9b191c03db9641d0ad7e57f901665f06916e3020399f3483" | xxd -r -p > vmk
$ sudo dislocker -V /dev/nvme0n1p3 -K vmk /mnt/dec/
$ sudo mount -t ntfs-3g -o loop /mnt/dec/dislocker-file /mnt/win/
```

<figure style="display: inline-block;">
  <img style="vertical-align: top;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/bitlocker/mount_volume.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" alt="Mounting decrypted volume">
  <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Mounting decrypted volume</figcaption>
</figure>

The volume is now decrypted and accessible. Let's enjoy this moment together for a bit before continuing.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

The volume is accessible but in read-only mode, this is because Windows 10/11 have a default feature (Fast Startup) that it enters in a hibernation state-style even when the user requests a shutdown. If you want to force the read-write mode you have issue the mount command like below: 

```bash
$ sudo mount -t ntfs-3g -o loop,remove_hiberfile,rw /mnt/dec/dislocker-file /mnt/win/
```

If it does not work, issue the following command before the mount:

```bash
$ sudo ntfsfix /mnt/dec/dislocker-file
```

If it doesn't work either then google is your friend because I have no idea. Nevertheless this approach is not recommended as it may lose data or even corrupt something.
<br /><br />


# Remediation

Regardless the presence or absence of the TPM chip, a pre-boot authentication with PIN, USB startup key or both should always be implemented. It works almost like a 2FA, ensuring the device can't boot or resume from hibernation until the correct 2FA is inputed. Even a weak password is better than no password.


# Final considerations

That's all friends, if you got so far thank you for your time and see again soon.
